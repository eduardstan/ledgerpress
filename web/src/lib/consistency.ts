/**
 * The consistency gate: the repository checked against itself.
 *
 * The site's claim is that every rendered fact can be opened to show the record
 * behind it. That claim is only worth making if the records cannot quietly
 * disagree with each other, so this module compares the ones that state the same
 * thing twice and refuses the build when they contradict.
 *
 * Three rules decide what is a contradiction and what is merely untidy:
 *
 *   1. **Exact keys only, never prose.** Two records are the same fact because
 *      they are the same YAML entry or the same BibTeX entry — never because
 *      their names look alike. Name matching fails in both directions on this
 *      repository's real data (`for` vs `of` in one venue name, a missing
 *      acronym in another), and a gate with a false positive is a gate that gets
 *      switched off in its first week.
 *   2. **A comparator that returns "unknown" does not fire.** An unreadable date
 *      or a fact that states no year is counted in the coverage below, not
 *      reported as a disagreement.
 *   3. **Contradiction fails the build; incompleteness does not.** Two records
 *      that cannot both be true are a logic error. A record that is merely
 *      missing something is a state of the world, and failing on it would force
 *      someone to invent data to unblock a truth-checker.
 *
 * Where it runs: `astro:build:done` (`astro.config.mjs`), which runs on
 * `astro build` and never on `astro dev`. The author editing `cv.yaml` at 2am is
 * never blocked; nothing publishable ships a contradiction. The same function
 * renders its findings on the page under the inspect switch, and
 * `consistency.test.ts` asserts on it, so the page, the build and the test all read
 * one verdict.
 *
 * The gate states its own coverage. "0 contradictions" without "over how many
 * comparisons" is decorative.
