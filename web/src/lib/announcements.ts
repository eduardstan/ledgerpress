/**
 * The announcement feed, derived from the facts themselves.
 *
 * There is no news content in this repository. Every item below is generated
 * from a fact it already holds:
 *
 *   `content/cv.yaml`          every section — appointments, service, awards, …
 *   `content/publications.bib` publications, preprints, released software
 *   `content/talks.bib`        invited talks, oral and poster presentations
 *   `content/posts/`           writing
 *
 * A fact is announced on the date it carries. Most carry one already: a talk has
 * an ISO `date`, a post has a front-matter `date`, an award has a month, a paper
 * has at least a `year`. An `announced` key is written onto a fact only when the
 * announcement genuinely happened on a date the fact does not otherwise state.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a date. A fact whose finest available date is a year is
 * placed at the start of that year and **shown as a year**, so the feed never
 * claims a precision its sources do not have. `Announcement.precision` carries
 * that distinction to the page. A fact with no defensible date at all is not
 * guessed at: it is listed, with the reason, in `undated`.
